Multi-Paradigm Programming

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.[1]
Common programming paradigms include:
1. imperative in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
    - procedural which groups instructions into procedures,
    - object-oriented which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on,
2. declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
    - functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
    - logic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
    - mathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
