Multi-Paradigm Programming

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.[1]
Common programming paradigms include:
1. imperative in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
    - procedural which groups instructions into procedures,
    - object-oriented which groups instructions with the part of the state they operate on,
2. declarative in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
    - functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
    - logic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
    - mathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
languages that fall into the imperative paradigm have two main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects, in which state 
can be modified at one point in time, within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in time inside a different unit of code. The communication between the units of code is not explicit. 
Meanwhile, in object-oriented programming, code is organized into objects that contain a state that is only modified by the code that is part of the object. Most object-oriented languages are also imperative languages. 

To make programs simpler for a human to read and write, imperative statements can be grouped into sections known as code blocks.[2]
The blocks of code are known as procedures. Once a procedure is defined, it can be used as a single imperative statement, abstracting the control flow of a program.
The process allows the developer to express programming ideas more naturally. This type of imperative programming is called procedural programming, and it is a step towards higher-level abstractions such as declarative programming.
In procedural programming, the code is organised by using procedures and/or functions, while object orientated programming is based on objects which use methods and functions.
Examples of imperative programming languages:
    - C
    - C++
    - Java
    - Julia
    - Python
    - Ruby
